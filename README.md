# Introduction to TensorFlow
In this tutorial the steps needed to clean a dataset and prepare it for modeling using the machine learning library TensorFlow. The tutorial uses the [Wine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml).

## Installation Notes
There are a few packages you will need in order to run this tutorial. We recommend installing the miniconda environment, which makes the installation process quite easy. Please see the README file for this mornings session for instructions on how to install miniconda.

In order to run this tutorial, you will need the following Python packages:
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn
* skflow
* tensorflow

The first five packages can be installed with the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas seaborn sklearn skflow
```

For TensorFlow, the installation depends on your environment. Below are installation instructions. For detailed instuctions, please see the TensorFlow [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md) file.

### NOTE:
What's better to use? The virtual environment or normal pip installation?
